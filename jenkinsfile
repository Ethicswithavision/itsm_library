You are a senior platform/IaC engineer. I have an EKS Terraform module checked out locally on my laptop. I am migrating AWS authentication from static credentials (Jenkins IAM user / access keys) to Terraform Cloud Dynamic Credentials using AWS IAM OIDC (TFC run role).

TASK:
1) Inspect this repo/module and identify every place that controls AWS authentication and role assumption:
   - provider "aws" blocks (and aliases)
   - any assume_role / role_arn / external_id usage
   - any references to access_key/secret_key, shared_credentials_file, profile, env vars
   - any modules/resources creating IAM roles, policies, or trust relationships for Terraform execution
   - any references to Terraform Cloud variables like TFC_AWS_PROVIDER_AUTH or TFC_AWS_RUN_ROLE_ARN
   - any docs/examples/templates that show how to configure workspaces

2) Output a change plan with EXACT file paths and line-level guidance under these headings:
   A. What to remove (static creds paths)
   B. What to add/modify (OIDC + run role pattern)
   C. What stays unchanged (EKS IRSA OIDC provider etc.)
   D. Workspace naming / condition bindings that must be matched (org/project/workspace claims)
   E. Risk checklist (what breaks if missed)

3) For IAM trust: verify whether this module owns the “terraform execution role” in workload accounts.
   - If the role is created outside (service catalog), then output only the required INPUTS/variables and how the module consumes role ARN.
   - If the role is created inside, then propose the trust policy structure needed for Terraform Cloud OIDC with conditions for:
       - Terraform Cloud organization
       - Terraform Cloud project
       - Terraform Cloud workspace name pattern (prefix + wildcard)
     (Do NOT invent values; show placeholders.)

4) Create a Mermaid diagram that shows:
   - Terraform Cloud Workspace -> OIDC -> AWS STS AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity -> IAM Role -> AWS APIs (EKS/EC2/IAM/etc.)
   - Clearly separate “Terraform Cloud OIDC provider in IAM” vs “EKS cluster OIDC provider for IRSA” to avoid confusion
   - Include boxes for “Repo/module changes” showing which files/resources are affected

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Start with a repo scan checklist (what you looked for)
- Then the change plan (A–E) with file paths
- Then Mermaid diagrams:
   Diagram 1: Auth flow (sequence diagram)
   Diagram 2: Module impact map (flowchart)
- Keep it specific to this module; if you can’t find something, explicitly say “not found”.

NOW WAIT FOR ME TO PASTE THE REPO STRUCTURE OR FILE CONTENTS IF YOU NEED IT, but first tell me which files you want to see (top 5).
