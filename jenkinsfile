Create a Mermaid flowchart that shows a clean Backstage model with two separate catalog items:

1) A Backstage Component representing a service source repository
   - Contains application code
   - Contains a Dockerfile
   - Contains CI pipeline configuration
   - Lives in Bitbucket

2) A Backstage Resource representing an AWS ECR repository
   - Used only for storing container images
   - No application source code

Flow requirements:
- Backstage Catalog contains both the Component and the Resource
- The Component is linked to the ECR Resource (dependsOn / produces relationship)
- Bitbucket hosts the source repository for the Component
- CI pipeline builds the image from the Component’s repo
- The pipeline pushes the image to the ECR Resource
- EKS later pulls images from ECR (read-only relationship)

Use clear labels and directional arrows.
Keep Component and Resource as separate objects but visually connected.
