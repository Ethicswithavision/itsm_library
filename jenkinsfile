You are a senior Terraform and AWS expert.

I am working on a Terraform monorepo that deploys EKS using a wrapper/root module that calls multiple child modules. We are planning to upgrade the AWS provider to hashicorp/aws v6.

Your task is to analyze this repository only for provider compatibility, not functionality changes yet.

Please do the following:
	1.	Scan all Terraform files (versions.tf, providers.tf, *.tf) and list every required_providers block that references hashicorp/aws.
	2.	Identify any version constraints that would block or conflict with AWS provider v6 (for example < 6.0, ~> 5.x, pinned versions, etc.).
	3.	Check whether a .terraform.lock.hcl file exists and whether it pins the AWS provider to a pre-v6 version.
	4.	Identify Terraform resources and data sources that are commonly impacted by AWS provider v6 upgrades, especially:
	•	IAM (aws_iam_role, aws_iam_policy_document)
	•	EKS (aws_eks_cluster, aws_eks_node_group, aws_eks_addon)
	•	Launch templates
	•	S3 resources
	5.	Highlight high-risk modules (wrapper vs child modules) that must be validated or upgraded before the root module can safely move to provider v6.
	6.	Clearly answer:
	•	Can the root module be upgraded to AWS provider v6 without breaking child modules?
	•	If not, which modules are blockers and why?
	7.	Provide a recommended upgrade strategy, choosing one:
	•	single PR upgrade
	•	staged upgrade using a test root/workspace
	•	required module refactors before provider upgrade

Do NOT assume resources can be destroyed and recreated.
Focus on compatibility, constraints, and migration safety, not refactoring yet.
